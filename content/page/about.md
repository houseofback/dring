We hope this website helps you gain an understanding of how our school is organised and gives you a flavour of the exciting opportunities on offer at Dringhouses Primary School.

> With its friendly, caring atmosphere it is often described by the community as a 'village school in York'. The children, parents, staff, governors and community are committed to working together to ensure the continuing success of the school.

As a team we strive to ensure that every child enjoys learning, feels proud of what they can do, and is confident that they can learn new skills and achieve their very best. If you haven't already visited, then please come and see the school in action. We would be delighted to meet you and feel sure that you would enjoy your visit!
