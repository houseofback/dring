This information may be expanded or be updated as we change or develop our site. For this reason, we recommend that you review this policy from time-to-time to see if anything has changed.

At present we collect information on our users in three ways:

* by examination of the log files that all visitors involuntarily leave when they visit any web content - this provides a limited amount of information though cannot identify the individual concerned;
* voluntary submission when a question is requested via the Contact Form;
* automatic collection of non-personal information and data through the use of Cookies.

The information collected is used to improve the content of the site, thus making your user experience more valuable. This information is NOT being shared with other organisations for marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files a web site uses to recognise repeat users, facilitate the any ongoing access to the site and facilitate the use of the site. Cookies also allow a site to track usage behaviour and compile site usage information that will allow for the improvement of content.
