# Project - School website

This repo is my set of Hugo files used to try and build a better website for my local school. My abmition here was to be serverless, to do so I have explored Hugo a static HTML generator. 

Todo: 
- Add more static content.
- Decide on a image gallery that supports multi-albums and mobile friendly. 

Current status - on hold.
