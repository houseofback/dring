At Dringhouses we have high aspirations and ambitions for all our children and we believe that no child should be left behind. We strongly believe that it is not about where you come from but your passion and thirst for knowledge, your dedication and commitment to learning and your right to an excellent education that make the difference. On that basis we are determined to ensure that our children are given every chance to realise their full potential. The [pupil premium](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/raising-the-achievement-of-disadvantaged-children/supporting-pages/pupil-premium) grant (PPG) is additional funding given to publicly funded schools in England to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils and close the gap between them and their peers.

### The PPG is paid to the school for:

* Pupils recorded on the January School Census who were eligible for and receiving Free School Meals (FSM);
* Pupils who have been eligible and receiving FSM at any time in the last six years, known as ‘Ever 6 FSM’;
* Children who have been Looked After (LAC) for at least one day as recorded in the March 2014 Children Looked After Data Return;
* Children Adopted from Care (Post-LAC) under the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and children who have left care under a Special Guardianship or Residence Order;
* A grant is also paid to the school for children from service families.

### Funding:

In the **2014 to 2015 financial year**, schools received:

* £1,300 for each Ever 6 pupil
* £300 for each Ever 4 service family
* £1,900 for each LAC / adopted on or after 30 December 2005

The number of pupils at Dringhouses Primary School eligible for PPG in January 2014 was 52 (including 8 service). The total amount of PPG received (April 2014 – April 2015) was £59,500.

The Pupil Premium Policy can be found in our Policies section on this website.

Here you will find details of how we spend the pupil premium and what impact this is having on pupils' achievement together with the latest government advice. The school underwent an Ofsted inspection in June 2015; the following points are drawn from the report:

* *Disadvantaged pupils, disabled pupils and those who have special educational needs benefit from effective support which enables them to achieve well across the school. The school makes good use of its pupil premium funding;*
* *Disadvantaged pupils presently are making similar progress to others within the school. In 2014, there were too few disadvantaged pupils to compare progress or attainment with national data without identifying the pupils. The school uses pupil premium funding effectively to support disadvantaged pupils, ensuring that there are no gaps between their attainment and that of others in the school.*
